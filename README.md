## Description

Change is difficult. It requires too much effort and stress. Sometimes it's easy to give up just thinking about how much you have to do. Stop it! No need to be afraid! No need to doubt! No big changes are needed! Just make one little step TODAY, and your life will change forever. There is no doubt to become a better version of yourself just today. And there are no excuses. Tomorrow isn't exist yet. Focus on today. Today is the day to make a small easy change. Unpasso supports you with these small changes, and one day you will be surprised and excited about how far you can go through small daily steps.
But we can help, but we won't do your job and won't make progress instead of you.
Unpasso isn't a website or just an app. It's a community of people who aren't afraid to become something different and a better version of themselves. This community supports everyone regardless of age, sex or nationality. Because your steps are always public, and they are your commitments to change. And your goals and your achievements inspire others to make their steps.

## Versions notes

3.737.2
The new improvements

3.737.2
Hi! There are several interface improvements based on Alexey Milchenko's feedback. Social achievements are added.
Also the AI goal generator is upgraded, now it works faster and processes more requests simultaneously.
However, generally speaking, it is a minor update, more news will come soon.

3.737.1
Hey there!
With this version you can not only support your friends' goals, but also personalise your appearance - now you can select your avatar by clicking on the image in the profile section.
And don't forget to set and complete a new goal today!
If you don't know what to do today - ask the machine for the help (the "generate a new goal" button).

3.737.0
Hi everyone!
Now Unpasso is a real community. You can be inspired by other people and inspire others in return. You can see and like goals of other members, add friends, and manage the privacy of your goals. There are a lot of other improvements also.
And another important thing: Unpasso is now powered by a smart machine based on the most advanced machine learning technologies. It can try to understand your personality based on your past goals and help you with your next steps. Ask it for help, and it will generate your new goal. While you try and use it, the AI will become smarter over time and give you more accurate results.

2.0.3
Hi there! Some people use this app every day. But the problem was that the screen with goals didn't refresh when the app was resumed from the background. It was impossible to add a new goal for today then. It required to completely be closed or moved to the profile screen and backward to refresh. Now the screen is refreshed when the app is resumed, and the date is changed.
Also the regulatory requirement was implemented: a user can delete their account on the profile page.

2.0.2
I didn't expect some people to try to mark a goal accomplished before deciding what needed to be done :)
So this small update fixes the problem of empty and duplicate goals.
Still, it has the same functions of setting a primary target for the day and a lot of small and funny activities to play with friends and family.

2.0.1
The whole app is redesigned, we have designed the new way to manage everyday goals and see your progress on the same screen (you can swipe left and right the current and the past gols). Also we have added achievements to motivate you make a progress.
And, finally, we have some fun tasks for your games with friends.
